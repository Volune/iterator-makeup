# iterator-mackup

"iterator-makeup" is a javascript library providing utility functions to work with iterators.

"iterator-makeup" is made to be efficiently used with the new [function bind syntax](https://github.com/zenparsing/es-function-bind) (This is still a proposal).

## Examples

```
anArray::valuesReverse()::filter(Boolean)::map(item => item.name)::toArray()
```
